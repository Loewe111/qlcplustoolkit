# QLC+ Toolkit

An online Toolkit to help automate some of the manual tasks in editing a QLC+ Project. I added the features that I missed the mossed.

You can:
- update Functions based on Channel Groups without manually reassiging the groups and setting Values.
- order Fixtures by their DMX Address
- rename Functions based on their parent Folder
